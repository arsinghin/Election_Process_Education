# Indian Election Process Education Assistant

Indian Election Process Education Assistant is a full-stack web application that helps users understand voter eligibility, registration steps, election timelines, and election-process FAQs for India.

The project contains:

- A **FastAPI backend** with rule-based voter eligibility checks, registration guide steps, timeline lookup, and an FAQ assistant.
- A **React + Vite frontend** with pages for eligibility, guide, timeline, and FAQ workflows.
- Google Cloud integrations for Firestore, Vertex AI, Translation API, Docker, Cloud Run, and GitHub Actions deployment.

## Features

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Voter eligibility checker | Evaluates age, citizenship, state code, and NRI status using deterministic backend rules. |
| Registration guide | Returns step-by-step voter registration instructions from a backend state machine. |
| Election timeline lookup | Reads constituency election events from Firestore by state code and optional constituency ID. |
| FAQ assistant | Uses security checks, optional translation, Firestore vector search, and Vertex AI to answer election-process questions. |
| Hindi and English frontend | Uses `i18next` and `react-i18next` for English and Hindi UI text. |
| API documentation | FastAPI serves OpenAPI JSON, Swagger UI, and ReDoc. |
| Docker support | Separate backend and frontend Dockerfiles are included. |
| Cloud Run deployment | The repository includes backend deployment automation for Google Cloud Run. |

## Quick Start

These commands run the backend and frontend locally on a fresh machine after prerequisites are installed.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
cd Election_Process_Education
```

### 2. Start the backend

Linux and macOS:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
cd backend
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --reload
```

Backend URLs:

- API root: <http://localhost:8080/>
- Health check: <http://localhost:8080/health>
- Swagger UI: <http://localhost:8080/docs>
- ReDoc: <http://localhost:8080/redoc>

### 3. Start the frontend

Open a second terminal.

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL:

- Application: <http://localhost:5173>

The Vite development server proxies `/api` requests to `http://localhost:8080`.
